Welcome to my GitHub page. I am a PhD candidate at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science where I study speciation of Neotropical birds ðŸ¦‰ðŸ¦œ. In the repositories below you'll find mostly Python scripts for processing population genetic data. Feel free to send me an email with any questions at *andre.e.moncrieff [at] gmail [dot] com*.
